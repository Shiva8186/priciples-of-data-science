Hereâ€™s the analysis that becomes easier with each of the visualizations:

Bar Plot: Average Scores by Gender

Analysis: This visualization helps in understanding gender-based performance disparities. By comparing the average scores of male and female students, educators can identify if there are significant differences in performance that might need addressing.

Histogram: Distribution of Math Scores

Analysis: This histogram reveals the distribution of math scores, showing how scores are spread across the range. It helps in identifying trends such as whether most students are scoring high, low, or around the average. Outliers and the overall performance pattern can be easily spotted.

Box Plot: Reading Scores by Race/Ethnicity

Analysis: This box plot highlights the variation and median reading scores among different race/ethnicity groups. It helps in identifying any disparities or gaps in performance across different racial/ethnic groups, guiding targeted interventions.


Strip Plot: Writing Scores by Lunch Type and Gender

Analysis: The strip plot shows how writing scores vary based on lunch type (a proxy for socio-economic status) and gender. It helps in understanding the impact of socio-economic factors on performance and whether there are differences between genders within each lunch category.

Heatmap: Correlation Matrix

Analysis: The heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlations between different score variables. It helps in identifying which subjects are closely related, allowing educators to understand how improvement in one area might affect another.
